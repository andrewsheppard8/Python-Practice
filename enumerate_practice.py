# Write a loop using enumerate that prints out only the even-indexed fruits (index 0, 2, 4, etc.) along with their index.

# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]
# for index,fruit in enumerate(fruits):
#     if index % 2 == 0:
        # print(fruit)


# Write a loop using enumerate that prints a message like this only for the names at odd indexes (1, 3, 5, ...):
# Index 1: Bob is at an odd position.
# Index 3: Diana is at an odd position.

# names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana", "Eve", "Frank"]

# for index,name in enumerate(names):
#     if index%2 == 1:
#         print(f"{name} is at an odd position.")

# You have a list of words
# Use a for loop with enumerate() to build a single string that looks like this:
# "0:zero | 1:one | 2:two | 3:three | 4:four"

words = ["zero", "one", "two", "three", "four"]
